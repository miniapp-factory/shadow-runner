Mini App Game Concept: “Shadow Runner"

Game Type:Reflex + Pattern Memory

 📱Platform:** Mobile mini-game


📘 Game Story**

You play as a Runner inside a digital world where the environment shifts between **light** and **shadow**.
Your goal is to survive as long as possible by tapping the correct action depending on the mode.

When the world turns **light**, obstacles become visible.
When it turns **dark**, obstacles disappear, but traps appear!

---

# 🕹️ **How to Play**

### **1. The world shifts every 5 seconds**

The background cycles between:

* ☀️ **Light Mode**
* 🌑 **Shadow Mode**

### **2. Player Controls**

You only have **two buttons**:

* **Jump** (tap left side)
* **Slide** (tap right side)

### **3. Obstacles by Mode**

| Mode      | What Appears           | What to Do                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ☀️ Light  | Walls + Spikes         | Jump or Slide to avoid      |
| 🌑 Shadow | Hidden traps that glow | Memorize patterns and avoid |

### **4. Pattern Memory**

Every time the world switches, the **trap pattern changes**.
Players must memorize the glowing trap pattern in Shadow Mode before it disappears.

### **5. Scoring**

* +1 point for each obstacle survived
* +5 points for completing a full light/shadow cycle
* Game ends when you collide with anything

---

# 🧩 **Extra Features**

### **Power-ups**

* **Flash Burst** – briefly reveal shadow traps
* **Slow Time** – reduce world speed for 3 seconds
* **Shield** – survive one hit

### **Difficulty Levels**

* Easy: Slow world switching
* Normal: Standard speed
* Hard: Faster switching + random fake traps

### **Leaderboard**

* Track top local scores
* Optional online ranking (for future enhancements)

---

# 🎨 **UI / Visual Style**

* Neon cyberpunk aesthetic
* Light/Shadow theme switching animations
* Simple two-button control layout

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized neon runner silhouette in a cyberpunk cityscape. The runner is mid‑jump, outlined in bright electric blue against a dark background. Behind the runner, a gradient transitions from deep purple at the top to electric teal at the bottom, with subtle pixelated stars. The logo should convey motion and contrast, reflecting the light/shadow theme of the game. The runner’s silhouette is simple but dynamic, with a slight tilt to suggest speed. The overall composition is balanced, with the runner centered and the gradient filling the background. The design should be bold and eye‑catching, suitable for a mobile app icon.

#### The output of the shadow runner the UI of the game  

The UI for “Shadow Runner” will need to be added or updated in a few places.  
Please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – the main page that will render the game UI.  
2. `mini-app/components/game.tsx` – a new component that implements the game logic and layout.  
3. `mini-app/components/ui/button.tsx` – if you want to customize the two‑button controls.  

Once you add these files, I’ll generate the necessary changes.

I’ll need to add a new component that implements the Shadow Runner UI.  
Please add the following file to the chat:

```
mini-app/components/game.tsx
```

Once that file is added, I’ll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to:

1. Create the `Game` component in `mini-app/components/game.tsx`.
2. Update `mini-app/app/page.tsx` to import and render that component.

Let me know when the new file is added.

# 🕹️ **Mini Game: “Dash Block”**

## 🎮 **Game Description**

“Dash Block” is a fast-paced, single-tap platform runner where the player controls a small square that automatically moves forward. The goal is to avoid obstacles by jumping at the right time.

The game gets faster as the player survives longer.

---

# 📜 **Game Rules**

### **1. Automatic Movement**

* The player block moves forward continuously.
* The player cannot stop or slow down.

### **2. Jump to Avoid Obstacles**

* Tap / Press Space / Click to make the block **jump**.
* Tapping again mid-air does *not* double jump (classic Geometry Dash style).

### **3. Collision = Game Over**

The game ends if the block touches:

* A spike
* A tall wall
* Any moving obstacle

### **4. Level Progression / Speed Increase**

* The longer you survive, the faster the block moves.
* Higher speed = higher difficulty.

### **5. Scoring System**

* +1 point for every second survived.
* Optional: +5 bonus points for passing a special marker.

### **6. Win Condition (Optional for mini game)**

* Reach the end of the map (if there is a fixed level)
  OR
* Set a high score on endless mode.

---

# 🎯 **Game Features**

* Simple tap/spacebar control
* Basic geometry-style shapes
* Smooth continuous movement
* Increasing difficulty
* Sound effect when jumping (optional)
* Restart button after death

---

# 🧱 **Game Objects**

### **Player Block**

* Shape: square
* Color: any (default blue)
* Behavior: runs & jumps

### **Obstacles**

* Spikes (triangles)
* Walls (rectangles)
* Moving enemies (optional)

### **Ground**

* Flat line the block runs on

The changes you’re asking for will touch the game logic and the page that renders it.  
The most likely files that need to be edited are:

1. `mini-app/components/game.tsx` – the component that implements the Dash Block gameplay.  
2. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – the page that imports and renders the `Game` component.  
3. (Optional) `mini-app/components/ui/button.tsx` – if you want to tweak the two‑button controls.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

#### Can you make it move the player with control button left and right and also the jump button  

The changes you’re asking for will need to be made in the **game component** that implements the Dash Block logic.  
Please add the following file to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```
mini-app/components/game.tsx
```

Once that file is added, I’ll give you the blocks to:

1. Add left/right movement controls.
2. Add a dedicated jump button.

Let me know when the file is added.
