+📘 Game Story**
+
+You play as a Runner inside a digital world where the environment shifts between **light** and **shadow**.
+Your goal is to survive as long as possible by tapping the correct action depending on the mode.
+
+When the world turns **light**, obstacles become visible.
+When it turns **dark**, obstacles disappear, but traps appear!
+
+---
+
+# 🕹️ **How to Play**
+
+### **1. The world shifts every 5 seconds**
+
+The background cycles between:
+
+* ☀️ **Light Mode**
+* 🌑 **Shadow Mode**
+
+### **2. Player Controls**
+
+You only have **two buttons**:

+
+### **3. Obstacles by Mode**
+
+| Mode      | What Appears           | What to Do                  |
+| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
+| ☀️ Light  | Walls + Spikes         | Jump or Slide to avoid      |
+| 🌑 Shadow | Hidden traps that glow | Memorize patterns and avoid |
+
+### **4. Pattern Memory**
+
+Every time the world switches, the **trap pattern changes**.

+
+### **5. Scoring**
+
+* +1 point for each obstacle survived
+* +5 points for completing a full light/shadow cycle

+# 🕹️ **Mini Game: “Dash Block”**
+
+## 🎮 **Game Description**
+
+“Dash Block” is a fast-paced, single-tap platform runner where the player controls a small square that automatically moves forward. The goal is to avoid obstacles by jumping at the right time.
+
+The game gets faster as the player survives longer.
+
+---
+
+# 📜 **Game Rules**
+
+### **1. Automatic Movement**
+
+* The player block moves forward continuously.
+* The player cannot stop or slow down.
+
+### **2. Jump to Avoid Obstacles**
+
+* Tap / Press Space / Click to make the block **jump**.
+* Tapping again mid-air does *not* double jump (classic Geometry Dash style).
+
+### **3. Collision = Game Over**
+
+The game ends if the block touches:
+
+* A spike
+* A tall wall
+* Any moving obstacle
+
+### **4. Level Progression / Speed Increase**
+
+* The longer you survive, the faster the block moves.
+* Higher speed = higher difficulty.
+
+### **5. Scoring System**
+
+* +1 point for every second survived.
+* Optional: +5 bonus points for passing a special marker.
+
+### **6. Win Condition (Optional for mini game)**
+
+* Reach the end of the map (if there is a fixed level)
+  OR
+* Set a high score on endless mode.
+
+---
+
+# 🎯 **Game Features**
+
+* Simple tap/spacebar control
+* Basic geometry-style shapes
+* Smooth continuous movement
+* Increasing difficulty
+* Sound effect when jumping (optional)
+* Restart button after death
+
+---
+
+# 🧱 **Game Objects**
+
+### **Player Block**
+
+* Shape: square
+* Color: any (default blue)
+* Behavior: runs & jumps
+
+### **Obstacles**
+
+* Spikes (triangles)
+* Walls (rectangles)
+* Moving enemies (optional)
+
+### **Ground**
+
+* Flat line the block runs on
