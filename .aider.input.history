+
+📘 Game Story**
+
+You play as a Runner inside a digital world where the environment shifts between **light** and **shadow**.
+Your goal is to survive as long as possible by tapping the correct action depending on the mode.
+
+When the world turns **light**, obstacles become visible.
+When it turns **dark**, obstacles disappear, but traps appear!
+
+---
+
+# 🕹️ **How to Play**
+
+### **1. The world shifts every 5 seconds**
+
+The background cycles between:
+
+* ☀️ **Light Mode**
+* 🌑 **Shadow Mode**
+
+### **2. Player Controls**
+
+You only have **two buttons**:
+
+* **Jump** (tap left side)
+* **Slide** (tap right side)
+
+### **3. Obstacles by Mode**
+
+| Mode      | What Appears           | What to Do                  |
+| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
+| ☀️ Light  | Walls + Spikes         | Jump or Slide to avoid      |
+| 🌑 Shadow | Hidden traps that glow | Memorize patterns and avoid |
+
+### **4. Pattern Memory**
+
+Every time the world switches, the **trap pattern changes**.
+Players must memorize the glowing trap pattern in Shadow Mode before it disappears.
+
+### **5. Scoring**
+
+* +1 point for each obstacle survived
+* +5 points for completing a full light/shadow cycle
+* Game ends when you collide with anything
+
+---
+
+# 🧩 **Extra Features**
+
+### **Power-ups**
